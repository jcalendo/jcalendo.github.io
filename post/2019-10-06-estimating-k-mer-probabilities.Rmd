# Estimating k-mer probabilities

Disclaimer: This was a challenge problem set forth in *Bioinformatics Algorithms An Active Learning Approach* by Phillip Compeau and Pavel Pevzner (2018). I borrow heavily from their examples.

## The Problem

What is the probability that a some k-mer will appear at least $t$ times as a sub-string of a random string of length $N$ composed of alphabet $A$?

For example, what is the probability that some 9-mer appears 3 or more times in a random DNA string of length 500?


## A Warm up Question - what's the probability of finding a given $Pattern$

Let $Pr(N, A, Pattern, t)$ denote the probability that a string $Pattern$ appears $t$ or more times in a random string of length $N$ formed by an alphabet of $A$ letters.

For example, we can compute $Pr(4, 2, "01", 2)$ by brute force as follows:

```python
import itertools
import fractions
from numbers import Real


def find_pattern_probability(N: int, A: str, pattern: str, t: int) -> Real:
    """Find the probability of a given substring"""
    possible_strings = itertools.product(A, repeat=N)
    
    k = len(pattern)
    count = 0
    n = 0
    
    for string in possible_strings:
        s = "".join(string)
        n += 1
        occurences = 0
        for i in range(len(s)-k+1):
            if s[i:i+k] == pattern:
                occurences += 1
        if occurences >= t:
            count += 1
            
    return fractions.Fraction(count, n)


print(find_pattern_probability(N=4, A="01", pattern="01", t=2))
```

> 1/16

However, this approach becomes computationally intractable as the alphabet and the string length increase. The number of possible strings is defined by the number of permutations with repetition which is, $A^N$ where $A$ is the alphabet size (in this case 2) and $N$ is the string length.

For example, fixing the alphabet size at 2 results in the following number of unique combinations for each string length up to 100

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
plt.style.use('ggplot')
%matplotlib inline


A = 2                                           # alphabet size of binary string ('0', '1')
N = np.array([range(2, 101)])                   # string length
possible_strings = np.power(A, N, dtype=float)  # number of permutations with replacement for each length

plt.scatter(N, possible_strings)
plt.yscale('log')
plt.xlabel('Length of string - N')
plt.ylabel('Number of possible strings')
plt.title("Number of Possible Binary Strings of String Length N")
plt.show()
```

This isn’t even the complete story. Another problem arises when we consider that certain combinations appear more frequently than others in a random string, i.e. the **overlapping words problem**. For example, $Pr(4,2,"01",2) = 1/16$ whereas $Pr(4,2,"11",2) = 3/16$ since two occurrences of “01” can never overlap each other in any 4-mer.

Given the high number of possible strings and the fact that overlapping strings occur with different probabilities we need to instead estimate $Pr(N, A, Pattern, t)$. We can estimate this value by assuming that each sub-string is non-overlapping and then imagine inserting the sub-string $t$ times within a string. For example, we can insert the sub-string “A” into “XXX” in the following ways:

>AXXX
>
>XAXX
>
>XXAX
>
>XXXA

There are 4 ways to insert “A” into “XXX”. Because there are $3^3 = 27$ possible ternary 3-mers we can approximate the number of ternary 5-mers that contain at least one instance of “A” as $4 \times 27 = 108$. And because there are $3^5 = 243$ possible ternary 5-mers we get the estimated $Pr(5, 3, "A", 1) = 108/243 = 4/9 \approx 44\%$

From Compeau and Pevzner (2018):


>If we select exactly $t$ of these occurrences, then we can think about $Text$ as a sequence of $n = N - t * k$ symbols interrupted by $t$ insertions of the k-mer $Pattern$. If we fix these $n$ symbols, then we wish to count the number of different strings $Text$ that can be formed by inserting $t$ occurrences of $Pattern$ into a string formed by these $n$ symbols.”

This means that the problem can get broken down into, “How many ways can we choose $t$ occurrences of a $Pattern$ in a string of length $n = N - t * k$”. In other words, $n\ Choose\ r$.

Taken together we will have $n + t$ occurrences of “X”. From these occurrences we wish to choose $t$ placements. This gives us the binomial coefficient $n +t \choose t$. Now we need to multiply this by the number of strings from an alphabet $A$ of length $n$ that we can insert $t$ occurrences, $A^n$. Finally, divide by the total number of possible strings for an alphabet of size $A$ and length of $N$. This yields our estimate:

$$Pr(N, A, Pattern, t) \approx \frac{{n+t \choose t} A^n}{A^N} = \frac{{N - t * k + t \choose t} A^{N-t*k}}{A^N} = \frac{{N - t * (k - 1) \choose t}}{A^{t*k}}$$

Now we are ready to develop an approximation


```python
from scipy.special import binom


def approximate_pattern_probability(N: int, A: int, pattern: str, t: int) -> None:
    """Return the approximate probability of substring t in text of length N composed of A symbols"""
    k = len(pattern)
    numerator = int(binom(N - t * (k - 1), t))
    denominator = int(A**(t*k))
    frac = fractions.Fraction(numerator, denominator)
    Pr = numerator / denominator
    
    print(f"Approximate probability of {t} occurrences of {pattern} in text of length {N} composed of {A} symbols is {frac} or {Pr}")
  
  approximate_pattern_probability(30, 4, "ACTAT", 3)
```

>Approximate probability of 3 occurences of ACTAT in text of length 30 composed of 4 symbols is 51/67108864 or 7.599592208862305e-07

This approximation is okay if we know the $Pattern$. The original question was to approximate the probability of some k-mer appearing $t$ or more times.

We already have an approximation for the probability $p$ that some $Pattern$ appears $t$ of more times, therefore 1 minus this approximation will give us the probability that the $Pattern$ does not appear $t$ or more times. Since we know that there are $A^k$ possible k-mer patterns, we can approximate the probability that all $A^k$ patterns appear fewer than $t$ times in a random string of length $N$ using $(1 - p)A^k$.

Again, we can flip this probability by subtracting it from 1 in order to approximate the probability that some k-mer appears greater than $t$ times in a random string of length $N$: $Pr(N, A, k, t) \approx 1 - (1 - p)A^k$. Now we can get an estimate for the original question.

Simply plugging this equation into a function will cause an overflow. Therefore we can approximate our estimate by assuming that $p$ is about the same for every $Pattern$. Thus we get:

$$Pr(N, A, k, t) \approx p * A^k$$

```python
def approximate_kmer_probability(N: int, A: int, k: int, t: int) -> None:
    """Return the approximate probability that some k-mer appears t or more times in a random string of length N
    composed of alphabet size A"""
    numerator = int(binom(N - t * (k - 1), t))
    denominator = int(A**((t-1)*k))
    frac = fractions.Fraction(numerator, denominator)
    Pr = float(frac)
    
    print(f"Approximate probability of  at least {t} occurrences of {k}-mer in text of length {N} composed of {A} symbols is {frac} or {Pr}")
    
approximate_kmer_probability(500, 4, 9, 3)
```

>Approximate probability of  at least 3 occurences of 9-mer in text of length 500 composed of 4 symbols is 4465475/17179869184 or 0.00025992485461756587

## The Approximate Probability

To answer the question, the probability that some 9-mer appears 3 or more times in a random DNA string of length 500 should be about 0.000259 however, this number is actually closer to 0.000769 $\approx 1/1300$ due to the overlapping words problem (Compeau and Pevzner, 2018).
