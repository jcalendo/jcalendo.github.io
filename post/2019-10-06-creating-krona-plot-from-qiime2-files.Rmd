[Krona](https://github.com/marbl/Krona) is a wonderful tool for interactively visualizing metagenomic samples. If you are using Qiime2 however, shaping your data into a format that can be used by Krona is not entirely straight-forward. Below, I hope to explain my workflow for creating Krona charts derived from a Qiime2 workflow. I will use the example files from the [Qiime2 Moving Pictures Tutorial](https://docs.qiime2.org/2018.11/tutorials/moving-pictures/) to show how a krona chart can be constructed from these QIIME2 artifacts.

## Preliminary Steps:

### Download table.qza, taxonomy.qza and sample metadata files

- [sample metadata](https://data.qiime2.org/2018.11/tutorials/moving-pictures/sample_metadata.tsv)
- [feature table](https://docs.qiime2.org/2018.11/data/tutorials/moving-pictures/table.qza)
- [taxonomy](https://docs.qiime2.org/2018.11/data/tutorials/moving-pictures/taxonomy.qza)

*Alternativelyâ€¦*

You could also download the .csv file available after creating and viewing the `taxa barplot` visualization. This csv file will contain all of the counts for every annotated ASV as well as the metadata, which is essentially what we will create using the artifacts above. 

### Install the necessary libraries

We will also need:

- `dplyr` (imported with `tidyverse` below)
- [Qiime2R](https://github.com/jbisanz/qiime2R) to easily extract data from the artifact files
- and [KronaTools](https://github.com/marbl/Krona/wiki/KronaTools) to create the Krona plots
